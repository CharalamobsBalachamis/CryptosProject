# CryptosProject
In this project i web scrape the price data for the most popular crypto currencies from 1/1/2020 to 6/5/2022.
I then calculate the rate of change of the price in that time frame and visualised it all on graphs.
Finally, I conducted an expolraroty data analysis on my findings and wrote a report.
